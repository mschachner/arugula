This is some text. It's actually not that hard to write text if all you need to do is make sure that the text is long enough to fill the page. Also, I'm using autocompletion to write this text, so it's not even that hard to write. I just write the start of the sentence and then let the computer finish it for me. Honestly, I prefer this to lorem ipsum. It has a lot more character. What else should I write here? Have I written enough text? Maybe I should write some more. I'm excited to keep developing this theme. I like learning how to write latex code and I can also put this in my teaching portfolio.
